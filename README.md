# SI-Helper

This is computer algebra program, designed to help in dynamics' calculation.

## Process architecture

### How it works

An expression can be a 'variable' expression, or a 'vector' expression. In a 'variable' expression only variable can be
manipulated, contrariwise in a 'vector' expression only vector can be manipulated. The nature of an expression does not
change the way it works.

Each expression is an interlocking of sub-expression. Each sub-expression can be a basic one, or an operation (called '
function'). This is achieved by creating an [interface](src/fr/seb/Expression.java)
that have all the typical properties, and then creating basic expression and function that implement this interface.

Currently, the [basic expression](src/fr/seb/vectors) are :

- variable (only for 'variable' expression)
- vector (only for 'vector' expression)

The [functions](src/fr/seb/function) are :

- Addition (both)
- Derivation (both, but needs a space for vectors)
- WedgeProduct (only for vectors)
- Product (only for variables)
- Cos & Sin (only for variables)
- Scalar (only for variables)
- ScalarProduct (only for variables)
- Power (only for variables)

### Example

So you might ask yourself what this mean in practice.

For instant, here is how the program represent : ![example formula](doc/image/readme-example1-1.png)

![what the program see](doc/image/readme-example1-2.png)

### Why things are like that

There are few advantages to represent things with this system. First, every calculation can be done recursively by
iterating throw each node. Also, by making the calculation process recursive, it's possible to **show calculation steps
to the user** (by limiting the recursion depth). Also, by making Addition and Product being trees (but not binary trees)
the program sees "a \times (b \times c)" as the same as "(a \times b) \times c" (which create to easily simplify
expression).

## Basic use (an example)

_This example was made on a previous version, there are minor differences to make it works._

```java
// initiate two variables for the angle
Variable alpha = new Variable("\\alpha", 3);
Variable beta = new Variable("\\beta", 3);

// initiate two distances
Variable a = new Variable("a", 1);
Variable b = new Variable("b", 1);

Space R0 = new FixedSpace(); // the main space

// A spinning space around the x axis with \alpha
Space R1 = new SpinningSpace(R0, 1, R0.getFixedPoint(), VECTOR.X, VECTOR.X, alpha, VECTOR.Y, VECTOR.Y);

// create A point so that \vec{OA} = a \vec{y} 
Point A = new Point("A", R0.getFixedPoint(), new ScalarProduct(a, R1.getUnitaryVector(VECTOR.Y)));

// A spinning space around the z axis with \beta
Space R2 = new SpinningSpace(R1, 2, A, VECTOR.Z, VECTOR.Z, beta, VECTOR.X, VECTOR.X);

// create G point so that \vec{AG} = b \vec{x} 
Point G = new Point("G", A, new ScalarProduct(b, R2.getUnitaryVector(VECTOR.X)));

// Calculate velocity of G in R2 compared to R0
Velocity v = new Velocity(G, R2);
Expression<Vector> velocityExpression = v.calculate(R0).calcul();
pl(velocityExpression);

pl("");

// Calculate acceleration of G in R2 compared to R0 
pl(velocityExpression.derive(R0).calcul());
````
The spinning spaces give these figures :

![the projections figures](doc/image/readme-example1-3.png)

At the end the console gives the expression of the acceleration of G in R2 compared to R0 !

## ToDo

1) Verify if hasMinus is pass when create new object (To check)
2) finish clone functions and equals functions (To check)
3) Test the new architecture (To check)
4) IntertiaMatrix class; AngularMomentum class; Torque class (To check)
5) A review of `calcul()` function usage (especially when multiple call are made in the same function)
6) An algorithm that simplify expressions
7) The wiki
8) A latex document generator



## Contributions

Contributions/Comments/Suggestions are welcome. I don't know everything, and I might have made overcomplicated or not
optimised things. The only thing that you need to think when contributing is that I want this program to be able to do
the calculations and display the steps.\
_Thank_.
